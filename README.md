## Optimization_Techniques
MATLAB codes based on Linear Algebra and Optimization.

- The main objective is to formulate mathematical models and to understand solution methods.
The emphasis will be on linear and non-linear programming problems based on:
- 1. Geometry of Linear Programming
- 2. Graphical Method
- 3. Linear Programming (LP) in Standard Form
- 4. Solution of LP by Simplex Method
- 5. Dual Simplex Method
